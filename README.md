## Deployment

### Deploy Web App + Cloud Functions

Deploy everything with a single command:

```bash
node deploy.js
```

This will:
1. Build the Expo web app for production
2. Deploy to Firebase Hosting
3. Your app will be live at https://precast-qc-tools-web-app.web.app

**Note:** Cloud Functions are deployed separately and require additional permissions (already configured).

### Deploy Cloud Functions Only

If you need to update just the Cloud Functions:

```bash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/tmp/firebase-sa.json npx firebase deploy --only functions --project precast-qc-tools-web-app
```

**Requirements:**
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` must be set in `.env` file (via Vibecode ENV tab)
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` (full JSON) must be set in `.env` file (via Vibecode ENV tab)

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Add these environment variables via the Vibecode ENV tab:
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Your Firebase project ID
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` - Your Firebase service account JSON

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
cd functions && npm install && cd ..
```

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
npx expo start
```

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **React Native** with Expo SDK 53
- **NativeWind** for styling (TailwindCSS)
- **Firebase SDK** for authentication and data
- **Expo Router** for navigation
- **Zustand** for state management

### Backend
- **Firebase Authentication** - User auth with email/password
- **Firestore Database** - Real-time data storage
- **Cloud Functions** - OpenAI Vision API proxy (Node.js 20)
- **Firebase Hosting** - Web app deployment

### Cloud Function: OpenAI Vision Proxy

Located in `/functions/index.js`, this serverless function:
- Receives image data from the web app
- Calls OpenAI GPT-4o Vision API
- Returns parsed product tag data
- Avoids CORS and SSL certificate issues

**Endpoint:** https://us-central1-precast-qc-tools-web-app.cloudfunctions.net/openaiVisionProxy
